# 🚀 Space Explorer

### A Space-Themed Web Application

## 🌌 Overview
Space Explorer is an interactive web application that brings space exploration to your fingertips. It integrates NASA and SpaceX APIs to provide real-time space data, tracks the International Space Station (ISS), and visualizes the solar system using Three.js.

## 🎯 Features
- **Live ISS Tracking**: Displays the real-time position of the International Space Station.
- **NASA APIs Integration**: Fetches astronomy pictures, Mars rover images, and space-related data.
- **SpaceX API Integration**: Displays past and upcoming rocket launches with detailed information.
- **Solar System Visualization**: Uses Three.js to create a 3D model of the solar system.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: Three.js, Leaflet.js (for ISS tracking)
- **APIs**:
  - NASA API (APOD, Mars Rover Photos, ISS Data)
  - SpaceX API (Launch Data)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify (Optional)
